* I completed this project as a capstone to Week 7 at The Iron Yard. This is a restaurant app that lists a menu and allows users to place an order which is then totaled for them. The assignment's objectives were to understand how to design and execute a front end application given ambiguous requirements by a client andunderstand how all of the pieces of Backbone + React fit together to create a dynamic frontend application. There's a link to the live project in the repo description and you can also clone the repo if you'd like to get it working locally.
